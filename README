This README file contains information on the contents of the
meta-ksp0728 layer.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

phyLinux
========
This release can be build with the phyLinux tool. phyLinux is a wrapper around
repo. repo itself grabs different git repositories defined in a xml
manifest. phyLinux itself then does the correct configuration setup.

Getting the sources
===================

If you have never used the Phytec git server before, you have to record
the SSH host key in your local ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. Execute

 ssh git@git.phytec.de info

on your machine and type 'yes' to accept the key. It is only needed for the
first connection.  For all subsequent checkouts via phyLinux you don't have to
execute the command again.

Along with access to the meta-skeleton repository you should have recieved
a xml file, defining the software release.

Start of in a new empty folder.

 wget ftp://ftp.phytec.de/pub/Software/Linux/Yocto/Tools/phyLinux
 chmod +x phyLinux
 ./phyLinux init -x <your_skeleton>.xml

You now have all needed sources inside sources/. In scripts/ there is
a customized init script. It copies bblayers.conf, local.conf and
conf-notes.txt templates. So the needed layers and machine is already
configured.

More configuration
==================
Maybe you want to configure DL_DIR and SSTATE_DIR in your local.conf?
hint: the init script searches for a site.conf at /etc/yocto/site.conf
or ~/.site.conf. This is a good place for your common configurations.


Start building
==============
To build the images for skeleton first the build enviroment needs to
be sourced:

 source sources/poky/oe-init-build-env

You will recieve an output with the buildable images.
Start the build with:

 bitbake <image-name>

Images
======
Images of the build can be found under

 build/deploy/images/<skeleton-machine>/.
